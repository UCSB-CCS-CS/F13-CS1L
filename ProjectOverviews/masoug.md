#Sammy's Project#
Right now, I have two ideas that I have been bouncing around in my head:
* A Google AppEngine app that behaves as a CMS...
* A 3D dodgeball game using Irrlicht+Bullet+network (hopefully)
* A pathtracer...
* Mini operating system (???)

Right now I'm debating between the game and the appengine projects; the major battling point is between practicality/awesomeness :)
Specifically, the game will take gobs more time and effort to complete, BUT its a little _funner_.
On the other hand, the appengine project is very likely to work, BUT it is mostly just reading the API docs and calling functions.

For now, I'm leaning towards the game...
