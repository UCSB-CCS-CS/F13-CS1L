My project will be to create an application that pulls web comics from several different sources and allow easy access
in a variety of different formats, including a chronological stream of all comics and individual streams for each comic.

My goal for next week (10/10/13) are:
* Learn about Google App Engine
* Figure out how to determine when a random web comic has updated (efficiently)
* Design and create a dummy GUI (if time permits)
