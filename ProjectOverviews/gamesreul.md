My project is going to be (an attempt at) an iOS-based application for relaying information to the greater UCSB population of the various volunteering opportunities available on campus on a daily basis, similar to how the Locos Rewards app provides a list of sporting events. The application will display the time of the event, a brief description, a location (that will quick-link to the Maps app for ease of direction), and a notification system for reminding users of upcoming events they wish to participate in or attend.

I intend to seek the assistance of the Associated Students program in order to get a complete list of the various volunteer opportunities, and as a novice programmer with little programming experience outside of Java, I would be extremely grateful for outside programming help as well.

My first week's progress: I determined my project and started learning XCode. I've yet to begin programming on the greater project at hand yet, but I intend to start in the next week or so (assuming, obviously, that I understand XCode well enough to do so by then.)

My second week's progress: As it turns out, learning an entirely new programming language takes more time than I thought. I have been diligently plugging away at an XCode tutorial that Sharon Levy sent me, and I am nearing the completion of the first of four sections. I believe that, by the time I have finished this and the next section in the tutorial, I will have a firm enough grasp on XCode to begin laying down the project. In the meantime, I intend to spend the next week continuing to work on learning XCode through my tutorials, and to start design work on the visual side of what I intend the app to look like when I have completed it.
