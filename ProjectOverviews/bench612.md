Bench612:

I want to make a playable version of Starcraft through a web browser or at least make progress toward that goal.

First I want to make a map editor that doesnt necessarily have to run in the web browser.

A map in starcraft is made of tiles shaped like rhombuses.

At least 2 different types of tiles distinguishing different types of terrain.

Each rhombus is drawn using 4 smaller rhombuses. The four smaller rhombuses all have the same properties of the larger rhombus but can be drawn differently.

Buildings and doodads are placed ontop a rectangular grid that is overlayed ontop of the grid of rhombuses

Plan: First make a map editor that can make terrain show properly.
      Then make it so that buildings can be placed on terrain properly.
      Then make units that can by placed on terrain properly and add pathing.
      Then make it support play through the internet
      
# Goal for 10/10/2013

Make an editor that can have rhombus tiles of different terrain and hopefully make the borders around the terrain work as well.
