I want to make a playable version of Starcraft through a web browser or at least make progress toward that goal.

First I want to make a map editor that doesnt necessarily have to run in the web browser.

A map in starcraft is made of tiles shaped like rhombuses.

At least 2 different types of tiles distinguishing different types of terrain.

Each rhombus is drawn using 4 smaller rhombuses. The four smaller rhombuses all have the same properties of the larger rhombus but can be drawn differently.

Buildings and doodads are placed ontop a rectangular grid that is overlayed ontop of the grid of rhombuses

Plan: First make a map editor that can make terrain show properly.
      Then make it so that buildings can be placed on terrain properly.
      Then make units that can by placed on terrain properly and add pathing.
      Then make it support play through the internet
      
# Goal for 10/10/2013

Make an editor that can have rhombus tiles of different terrain and hopefully make the borders around the terrain work as well.

#New Project
My new project is to make an app to teach people HTML tags. The game plays like a novel where you can make choices of dialogue in response to the story. HTML is taught when characters ask the player to type in code that is either supposed to produce a certain output or just repeat what the character said verbatm. In the cases where they have to produce some output there will be a preview of the webpage that they typed and an editor where they can type in the code.

#Goal for 10/17/2013
Make a GUI with scrollling text. When the text reaches the bottom, a "next" button becomes clickable. Also if time allows, have displayable dialogue responses that can be clicked.
#Goal for 10/24/2013
Make the text that shows in the GUI and the dialogue choices come from a text file or something. Make an editor that can be used to easily make dialogue trees. The editor should check to make sure that every dialogue choice leads to an end result.
