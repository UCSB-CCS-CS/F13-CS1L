Bench612:

I want to make a playable version of Starcraft through a web browser or at least make progress toward that goal.

First I want to make a map editor that doesnt necessarily have to run in the web browser.

A map in starcraft is made of tiles shaped like rhombuses.

At least 2 different types of tiles distinguishing different types of terrain.
