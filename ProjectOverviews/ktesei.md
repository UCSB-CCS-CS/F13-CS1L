My starting project is drawing a point set. But wait, there is more! The points are represented relative to eachother. A exists, B exists, C is to the right of the line formed by AB/BA. A shorter version of this is [A|Entire Plan],[B|Entire Plan],[C|AB],[D|AB,AC,BC],[E|AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD]. We can represent each of the relations in binary, so the entire representation can be reduced to an integer.

Given one of these "Siegel Space Representations", I must draw a point set it represents.
