CIJS - CCS 1L
===============

## Abstract
> A **C Interpreter** written in JavaScript

CI.js will be a loose port of PicoC - a C interpreter written in C - to the JavasScript language.

The primary motivation is to allow the C language to be interpreted within the browser - leading to many interesting applications.

There is also an undeniable opportunity for me to lear **a lot** about both C, JS, formal language theory, and interpreters.

## High-level milestones
- Learn C well
- Expand working knowledge of JS
- Interpreter fundamentals
