HI GUYYYYYYYYYYYZZZZZZZZZZZ AND GALLLLLLLLLLLLZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!

I'm working on the cijs project (C interpreter in JavaScript).

The repos relevant to this project are:
* https://github.com/ucsb-cs-education/picoc-ucsb
* https://github.com/ucsb-cs-education/ucsb-cijs


Week 1: I did some recon on what picoc can and can't do.   See:  https://code.google.com/p/picoc/wiki/Adding_native_C_library_functions
https://code.google.com/p/picoc/wiki/RunningPicoc

and if C90 is something you're familiar with and you'd like to know how picoc is NOT like it, this link would put your doubts to rest:
https://code.google.com/p/picoc/wiki/DifferencesFromC90

My goal for week 2: Continued to see what the limitations of picoc were. It seems like they're all pretty well documented on the URL above. 
Basically I took most of the labs I did for my CS24 class (which I deemed equivalent to the "Learn C the Hard Way" exercises) and making some minor edits according to the documentation on the picoc website seemed to do the trick. I can't seem to get it to like separate compilation. Everytime I try to run picoc with a .h file, it always throws a fit because "main" isn't defined... WHA HAPUN???
