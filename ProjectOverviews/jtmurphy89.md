Jtmurphy89's description goes here.

I'm working on the cijs project (C interpreter in JavaScript).

The repos relevant to this project are:
* https://github.com/ucsb-cs-education/picoc-ucsb
* https://github.com/ucsb-cs-education/ucsb-cijs


Week 1: I did some recon on what picoc can and can't do.   See:  insert URL here.

My goal for week 2: TBD
