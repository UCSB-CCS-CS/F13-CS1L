Procedurally generate a two-dimensional world inwhich you can control an army of gnomes to work the land.

The main idea is the generation which I have had trouble with in the past. There will be a set of rescources you can gather
to further your gnomic empire. You will require things like wood, stone, metal, food, etc. to build houses, walls, etc.


Required tasks will be
* Farming for food
* Building houses to increase population
* Diggy Diggy Hole
* Creating tools
* hunting?? (if i have time)
* Defending main base??


Potential Ideas for endgame:
* Have a limited number of days inwhich to build defenses and survive a single massive attack
* Try to get your gnomes to reach a certain population
* Attempt to find something critical underground.

Weekly progress:
Thought up idea, limited experiments in generation.

#Current Goal
Procedurally generate a world.
Also, decide if I want to make this side or overview.
Also, how does mouse?
