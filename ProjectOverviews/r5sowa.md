4 Oct. 2013 Friday
  -met with Alex, Austin, and Conrad for an overview of the Arduino MIDI shield and board and the program they had          previosuly created for it
  -used basic MIDI Arduino code by Nathan Seidle that makes the Arduino play chromatic scales with each MIDI instrument
  -expanded upon this code using int arrays to define different note increments of a scale
      -using int array allows one to create a different array for each scale mode that can easily be switched between,          rather than hard coding a separate noteOn function for each note of each scale
      		-makes it possible to play multiple and varying scale modes
  
  Goals for next week:
  -get reacquainted with Arduino accelerometer shield and program
  -figure out how to get it to talk/feed data to MIDI program
  -use it to control some aspect of the sound/notes
  		-i.e. pitch, velocity, amplitude/loudness, instrument number, scale mode
  
  Longterm Goals:
  -synchronized visualization with Processing
  -add back the other sensors, etc on Alex and Austin's original project
  -add range finder and 3D controller that Kevin was talking about in class
