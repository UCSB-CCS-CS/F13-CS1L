Project overview for Christian Daley

* Baseball game
* in space
* with planets and gravity physics
* different charachters to play as
* really cool sound effects

So far I have a basic menu screen implemented

Goals for 10/10:

* Clean up the menu screen a bit and make it look nicer
* Begin implementing planets
* The planets should be placed in such a way that no planets are overlapping and they are reasonably spread out
